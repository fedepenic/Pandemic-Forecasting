# Pandemic Forecasting

## Project Requirements:

- Golang: Recommended version 1.20.6
- Python: Recommended version 3.11.4
- Pandas library (Python).
- Statsmodels library (Python).
- Matplotlib library (Python).

## Instructions

### Windows

In order to run the program on Windows, open a CMD on the project directory and type the following command:

```
$ run-predictions.bat
```

### Unix like systems (Linux, macOS, etc)

In order to run the program on unix like systems, open a terminal on the project directory and type the following two commands:

```
$ go run main.go
$ python prediction.py
```

Alternatively, a script could be made in order to run both commands with a single instruction, similar to what was done on Windows.
